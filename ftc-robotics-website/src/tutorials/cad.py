    """
    - **Start Simple**: Begin with basic shapes and gradually add complexity to your designs.
    - **Use Constraints**: Apply constraints to ensure parts fit together correctly.
    - **Plan Your Design**: Sketch your ideas on paper before starting in CAD to save time.
    - **Test Fit**: If possible, 3D print your designs to test their fit and functionality before finalizing.

    Remember, practice makes perfect! The more you use CAD software, the more proficient you'll become.

st.markdown(
    """
    - **Keep It Organized**: Use layers and groups to keep your design organized.
    - **Optimize for Printing**: If you plan to 3D print your designs, consider the printer's capabilities and limitations.
    - **Document Your Process**: Keep notes on your design decisions and iterations for future reference.

    By following these best practices, you'll create effective and efficient designs for your FTC robot.
