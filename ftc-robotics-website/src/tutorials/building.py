    Your robot will consist of various components, including:
    - **Chassis**: The base structure of your robot.
    - **Motors**: Used for movement.
    - **Sensors**: For detecting the environment.
    - **Controllers**: To manage the robot's functions.
    - **Wiring**: To connect all components.
    """

st.header("2. Assembly Guidelines")
st.markdown(
    """
    - **Start with the Chassis**: Ensure it is sturdy and can support all other components.
    - **Secure Motors Properly**: Use screws and brackets to attach motors to the chassis.
    - **Organize Wiring**: Keep wires tidy to avoid tangling and interference with moving parts.
    - **Test Stability**: After assembly, check for any loose parts or instability.

st.header("3. Tips for Structural Integrity")
st.markdown(
    """
    - Use lightweight materials to reduce the overall weight of the robot.
    - Reinforce joints with additional brackets or supports.
    - Ensure that the center of gravity is low to prevent tipping.

st.header("4. Recommended Materials")
st.markdown(
    """
    - **Aluminum**: Lightweight and strong, ideal for the chassis.
    - **Plastic**: Good for non-load bearing parts.
    - **Wood**: Can be used for prototyping but may not be as durable.
